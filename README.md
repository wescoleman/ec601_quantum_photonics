# Introduction
In the year 1961, Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce invented ‘Silicon chip’, an invention that changed the course of computers. Shrinking a room sized computer into a handheld device, from 5.3Hz clock (Z3 computer-1941)/2.25MHz clock (UNIVAC I -1951) to 8722.78MHz clock (AMD FX-8370) this rapid advancement in technology is due to silicon chip technology. In 1965, Gordon Moore made a statement, he stated that “the number of transistors on a chip doubles every 24 months”[1].This statement was held true. But from the past few years, the number of transistors on a chip reached saturation due to technological limitation to fabricate transistors under 3nm. Even if we find a way around it in near future, there is always the problem of quantum tunneling of electrons. Because of this, controlling and maintain the state of the transistors under 3nm is something which won’t be achieved in the near future as well. Let us consider someone will come up with a way to solve this. Then The Switching speed of the transistor will say Hi!. The only reason we scale down the transistors is to achieve low power consumption, high speed and to improve efficiency. But there is a limit to how many times you can switch between the states of the transistor. “Now a days, it’s a feat for most elite of silicon to  even maintaining 5GHz for more than a few seconds. Even if we manage the switching speed the prime thing that will get effected is efficiency. For instance a 10 core CPU (i9) uses 100W @4.4GHz and it will easily reach 300W @5.4GHz i.e. the inefficiency is tripled to get 20% increase in performance”[2].

Photonic Chip can overcome the limitations of Integrated circuits. An integrated circuit (IC) consists of electric components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors and transistors. Similarly in Photonic Chip the optical components are made up of waveguides(similar to resistors and wires),Lasers(similar to transistors),phase shifters and polarizers. In IC’s electric flux flows through the circuit and similarly photos are the carriers in Photonic Chip.

Quantum is something which is at the end of the spectrum of downscaling FET's.A qbit can be represented by the spin of an elctron or by  the polarization of a single photon in which the two states can be taken to be the vertical polarization and the horizontal polarization.In a classical system, a bit would have to be in one state or the other. However, quantum mechanics allows the qubit to be in a coherent superposition of both states simultaneously, a property that is fundamental to quantum mechanics and quantum computing.Quantum photonics uses the  photon as qbit.

Other fundamental properties utilized in quantum computing are probability interference and entanglement. While probability density curves are all positive with an area of 1, their square root allows negativity. This is how scientists have been able to create a model of quantum mechanics where probabilities of states can cancel due to their interaction and agree with experiments while also letting outcomes be probabilistic. The square roots of probabilites are called probability amplitudes and they exist as solutions to the schrodinger equation. 

Entanglement is similar to classical probabilistic correlation. Meaning that given 1 measured state of a particle there is some certainty in what the state of another qubit's state is. This can be absolutely certain at times. entanglement often occurs due to some interaction between particles, like a collision or through a photon splitting into 2. Due to laws like conservation of momentum we can have quantum correlation between particles.

Shor's algorithm is a great algorithm to put all of these concepts together while solving an intriguing particle. meaning if you can understand the algorithm, you'll show a strong level of understanding in the fundamentals of quantum computing.

# Quantum Algorithm

Quantum algorithms are carried out through leveraging physical properties of superposition, interference, and entanglement. There's no set method for developing algorithms and many people are coming up with new ideas in this space today. Many quantum algorithms involve setting up a physical system that lets your realize single qubit/qumode and double qubit/qumode gates. A great inexpensive resource for learning about these is in a book called Quantum Computing for Everyone by Chris Bernhardt.

A basic idea for developing an algorithm could go as such,

1. set up a large superposition of entangled states
2. create some computation through the use of single and double qubit gates
3. measure that computation to partially collapse the states into a smaller set of more useful states
4. perform a unitary operation on this set of states that will cancel certain probabilites
5. repeat 3 and 4 in any order until you wind up with a final state measurement with a high probability of giving you something useful

You can follow these steps through the Shor algorithm. There is a more detailed discussion in sprint 4 below.

# Applications 
* Machine Learning
* Quantum Simulation
* Graph Similarity
* Problems in NP
* Quantum Cryptography

# Limitations
* Quantum Memory - rapid decoherence in photons makes state preservation difficult
* Physical Implementations of Gates - certain gates require specific nonlinear interactions to occur. Current materials don’t have strong enough interaction to create these. Other methods through linear gates have been proposed but they come with their own issues
* Initialization - getting large sets of initialized to |0> entangled states is also difficult due to decoherence
